#The dataset includes the following files:

    'README.txt'

    'features_info.txt':  variables used as  vector.

    'features.txt':  features.

    'activity_labels.txt': Linkage the class labels-activity name.

    'train/X_train.txt': Training dataset.

    'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

    'test/X_test.txt': Test dataset.

    'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

files for train and test data

    'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who person performing  the activity for each window sample.  range between  1 to 30.

    'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row has  128 element vector.  same description for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis.

    'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt':  body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.

    'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt':  angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample.  units : radians/second.
